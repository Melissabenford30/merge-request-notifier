## Troubleshooting
### The tray icon is black even in dark mode
The tray icon color currently does not depend on your internal dark mode settings, but on the OS theme as detected via the Chromium engine. If the detection does not work, you may force dark mode on startup via `merge-request-notifier --force-dark-mode`.
